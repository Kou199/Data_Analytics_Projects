Create a real state project using R script where below details are given like project requirements and process and data dictionary and dataset name,

project requirements: 
Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers.
Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.

Project Dataset : housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv
Dataset File path : housing_train - E:\R Projects\Dataset\housing_train.csv
housing_test - E:\R Projects\Dataset\housing_test.csv

Project Process : You need to use data housing_train to build predictive model for response variable "Price".
Housing_test data contains all other factors except "Price", you need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.
First build a predictive model for response variable "Price" using dataset housing_train.csv.
Second use Housing_test.csv dataset where contains all other factors except "Price", We need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.
