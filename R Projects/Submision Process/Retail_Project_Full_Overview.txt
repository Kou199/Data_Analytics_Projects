Create a retail project using R script where below details are given like project requirements and process and data dictionary and dataset name,
project requirements: 
This data set is related with retail domain and challenge is to predict whether a store should get opened or not based on certain factors such as sales, population,area etc.

Project Dataset : store_train.csv and store_test.csv

Project Process : First You need to use data "store_train.csv" to build predictive model for response variable ‘store’.
Second use dataset "store_test.csv" data contains all other factors except ‘store’, you need to predict that using the model that you developed and submit your predicted values in a csv files.
You have to submit the probability scores, not the hard classes.
If you are using decision trees or random forest here, probability scores can be calculated as below,
score=predict(rf_model,newdata= testdata, type="prob")[,2]
score=predict(tree_model,newdata= testdata, type=‘vector’)[,2]

Note : you need to submit probability of outcome being 1
Evaluation Criterion : auc score on test data. larger auc score, better Model

File Path of Dataset - 1. store_train - E:\R Projects\Dataset\store_train.csv
2. store_test - E:\R Projects\Dataset\store_test.csv

Project Data Dictionary :
Id : Store ID 
numeric sale figures for 5 types :
sales0
sales1
sales2
sales3
sales4

country : categorical :: coded values for country 
State : categorical :: coded values for State
CouSub : numeric :: subscription values at county level
countyname : Categorical :: county names
storecode : categorical :: store codes , this should not be used as is but can be source of a feature
Areaname : categorical :: name of the area , many times matches with county name
countytownname : categorical :: county town name
population : numeric :: population of the store area
state_alpha : categorical :: short codes for state
store_Type : categorical :: type of store 
store : categorical 1/0 : target indicator var 1=opened 0=not opened
