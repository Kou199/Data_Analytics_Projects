Housing Price Prediction Model in R
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to accurately estimate real estate property prices. Using a dataset of various housing features, the goal was to develop a robust model that can be a valuable tool for real estate firms to ensure consistent and data-driven pricing strategies. The model was developed using R programming.

Problem Statement
Accurate property valuation is a critical factor in the real estate market. The objective of this project was to create a predictive model to forecast a property's sale price, thereby assisting real estate companies in making informed pricing decisions and identifying key property attributes that drive value.

Datasets
The analysis was performed using two datasets:

housing_train.csv: This dataset contains a comprehensive set of features along with the target variable, "Price". It was used to train the predictive model.

housing_test.csv: This dataset contains the same features but without the "Price" variable. My final model was used to predict the prices for this dataset.

Evaluation Criterion
The performance of the model was evaluated based on the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on the test dataset. A custom scoring formula was used:

Score=212467/RMSE

The passing criterion for this project was to achieve a score greater than 0.51.
